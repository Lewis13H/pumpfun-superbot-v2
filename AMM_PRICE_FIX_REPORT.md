# AMM Price Calculation Fix Report

## Status: PARTIALLY FIXED ✅

### What's Working:
1. **Price Calculation**: AMM trades now have non-zero prices using fallback calculation
2. **Market Cap**: Properly calculated (e.g., $102,100 for token at $0.0001021)
3. **Trade Processing**: All trades being captured and processed
4. **Fallback Method**: When event reserves not found, uses trade amounts to calculate price

### Remaining Issues:
1. **Event Parsing**: Not extracting reserves from pump.fun AMM events
   - Shows warning: "No reserves found from events or pool state"
   - Falls back to trade amount calculation
2. **Token Saving**: Despite meeting $1,000 threshold, tokens not being saved to database
   - Possible issue in trade handler or database service

### Evidence from Test Run:

#### Sample Trades with Calculated Prices:
```
Token: 4F2akj9W... 
Price: $0.00010210
Volume: $1,247.78
Market Cap: $102,100 ✅ (SHOULD SAVE)

Token: Hiw4puJD...
Price: $0.00006904  
Volume: $1,039.10
Market Cap: $69,040 ✅ (SHOULD SAVE)

Token: AGJQigRn...
Price: $0.00013053
Volume: $913.55
Market Cap: $130,530 ✅ (SHOULD SAVE)
```

### Next Steps:
1. Debug why tokens aren't being saved despite meeting threshold
2. Fix event parsing to extract reserves from pump.fun AMM events
3. Verify trade handler is emitting proper events for database service

### Technical Analysis:
The fix successfully calculates prices using a fallback method when event reserves aren't available. However:
- Event parsing needs adjustment to extract `pool_base_token_reserves` and `pool_quote_token_reserves` from pump.fun events
- Token saving logic may need investigation in the trade handler or database service

## Conclusion:
The critical $0 price issue is FIXED. Tokens now have proper price calculations and market caps well above the $1,000 threshold. However, they're not being persisted to the database, which requires further investigation.
