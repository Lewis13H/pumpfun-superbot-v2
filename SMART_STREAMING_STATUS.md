# Smart Streaming & Connection Pooling Status

## Current State

### What's Working (Production)
- **Standard StreamManager**: Single shared gRPC connection
- **All existing monitors**: BC, AMM, Raydium monitors working perfectly
- **~14 TPS** on bonding curve trades
- **No connection issues** with current setup

### What's Been Built (Sessions 1-4)
1. **ConnectionPool** (`src/services/core/connection-pool.ts`)
   - Manages 2-3 concurrent gRPC connections
   - Health monitoring and auto-recovery
   - Connection prioritization

2. **SmartStreamManager** (`src/services/core/smart-stream-manager.ts`)
   - Extends StreamManager with pooling support
   - Subscription routing to different connections
   - Backwards compatible with existing monitors

3. **SubscriptionBuilder** (`src/services/core/subscription-builder.ts`)
   - Groups subscriptions by priority
   - Merges similar subscriptions
   - Smart routing logic

4. **LoadBalancer** (`src/services/core/load-balancer.ts`)
   - Real-time connection metrics
   - Dynamic load distribution
   - Automatic rebalancing

5. **TokenLifecycleMonitor** (`src/monitors/domain/token-lifecycle-monitor.ts`)
   - Consolidated BC transaction + account monitoring
   - Graduation detection
   - Lifecycle event tracking

## How to Enable Smart Streaming

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Safe)
```bash
# Enable smart streaming with connection pooling
USE_SMART_STREAMING=true npm run start
```

### Option 2: Update container-factory.ts (Permanent)
Change line 29 in `src/core/container-factory.ts`:
```typescript
const useSmartStreaming = true; // Always use smart streaming
```

## Why It's Not Enabled by Default

1. **Risk Management**: The current system works perfectly in production
2. **Testing**: New features need production testing before becoming default
3. **IP Whitelisting**: May need separate IP whitelisting for multiple connections
4. **Gradual Migration**: Following the MIGRATION_GUIDE.md approach

## Connection Architecture

### Current (Working)
```
All Monitors → StreamManager → Single gRPC Connection → Shyft
```

### Smart Streaming (Built, Not Active)
```
BC Monitors ────→ Connection 1 (High Priority)
                ↗
SmartStreamManager → ConnectionPool
                ↘
AMM Monitors ───→ Connection 2 (Medium Priority)
                ↘
Raydium ────────→ Connection 3 (Low Priority)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Smart Streaming**:
   ```bash
   USE_SMART_STREAMING=true npm run start
   ```

2. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Watch for connection errors
   - Compare TPS with standard streaming
   - Check load distribution

3. **Gradual Rollout**:
   - Run in parallel with standard setup
   - Monitor for 24-48 hours
   - Switch permanently if stable

## Session Progress

- ✅ Session 1: Connection Pool Foundation
- ✅ Session 2: Subscription Strategy
- ✅ Session 3: Load Balancing
- ✅ Session 4: TokenLifecycleMonitor
- ⏳ Session 5: TradingActivityMonitor
- ⏳ Session 6: LiquidityMonitor
- ⏳ Sessions 7-10: Pipeline & optimization

## Known Issues

1. **IP Whitelisting**: When testing isolated monitors, IP whitelisting errors occur
2. **Solution**: Use the full application with all monitors starting together

## Testing Smart Streaming

To verify smart streaming is working:
1. Enable via environment variable
2. Look for "SmartStreamManager" in logs
3. Check for multiple connection IDs
4. Monitor load distribution metrics
