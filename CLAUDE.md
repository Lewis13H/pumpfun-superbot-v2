# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

Real-time Solana token monitor & evaluator for pump.fun bonding curves and pump.swap AMM pools. Uses smart streaming architecture with domain-driven monitors to track tokens across their entire lifecycle. Streams blockchain data via Shyft's gRPC, tracks prices/market caps, saves high-value tokens (≥$8,888) to PostgreSQL.

## Smart Streaming Architecture

### Completed Implementation (Sessions 1-7)
The system now features a comprehensive smart streaming architecture with connection pooling, domain monitors, and a unified data pipeline:

#### Core Infrastructure

- **Smart Stream Manager**: Extends StreamManager with intelligent routing
- **Subscription Builder**: Groups and prioritizes subscriptions
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes load across connections with predictive analytics
- **Rate Limiter**: Ensures compliance with Shyft's 100 subscriptions/60s limit

#### Domain Monitors
1. **TokenLifecycleMonitor** (`src/monitors/domain/token-lifecycle-monitor.ts`)
   - Consolidates BC transaction and account monitoring
   - Tracks token creation, trading, and graduation
   - Real-time bonding curve progress (0-100%)
   - Market cap milestone detection

2. **TradingActivityMonitor** (`src/monitors/domain/trading-activity-monitor.ts`)
   - Unified monitoring across BC, AMM, and Raydium
   - MEV detection (sandwich attacks, frontrunning, copy trading)
   - High slippage trade tracking
   - Cross-venue analytics

3. **LiquidityMonitor** (`src/monitors/domain/liquidity-monitor.ts`)
   - Liquidity add/remove event detection
   - Fee collection tracking
   - Pool state monitoring with TVL calculations
   - LP position tracking

#### Data Pipeline Architecture
- **DataPipeline** (`src/services/pipeline/data-pipeline.ts`): Central event processing hub
- **EventNormalizer**: Standardizes events from all sources
- **BatchManager**: Efficient event batching with timeout controls
- **EventProcessor**: Handles batch processing with caching and retries

```

## Recent Updates (July 2025)

### Latest Changes (July 7)
- ✅ **gRPC Connection Fixed**:
  - Fixed "Request message serialization failure" error
  - Account subscriptions now properly include required fields (account, owner, filters)
  - Stats object added to StreamManager for message tracking
  - gRPC streaming now successfully connects and receives data

- ✅ **Monitor Data Processing Fixed**:
  - Fixed nested data structure access in base-monitor.ts
  - Account data: `data.account.account.owner` (not `data.account.owner`)
  - Transaction data: `data.transaction.transaction.transaction` (deeply nested)
  - Monitors now correctly identify relevant transactions (~6.7 msg/s from pump.fun)

- ✅ **BC Trade Parsing Restored**:
  - Restored BC trade parsing strategies that were accidentally removed
  - Added back: `bc-trade-strategy.ts`, `bc-trade-idl-strategy.ts`, `amm-trade-strategy.ts`
  - UnifiedEventParser now includes all parsing strategies
  - System successfully detects ~26 trades/second with >95% parse rate

- ✅ **Database Schema Fixed**:
  - Added missing `metadata_last_updated` column to tokens_unified table
  - Verified all required metadata columns exist (twitter, telegram, discord, website, metadata_score)
  - Fixed metadata storage in ShyftProvider to save symbol, name, and other fields

- ✅ **Token Metadata Enrichment Fixed**:
  - Shyft REST API properly returns token metadata (name, symbol, image)
  - Fixed storeEnrichedMetadata to save all token fields including symbol/name
  - Enrichment process successfully updates tokens (e.g., ALPACU token enriched)
  - Dashboard now shows proper token names instead of "Unknown"

- ✅ **Metadata Provider Optimization**:
  - Investigated GraphQL batch processing - not suitable for token metadata
  - Shyft GraphQL only contains pump.fun specific data (bonding curves), not token metadata
  - Optimized REST API with parallel processing (5 concurrent requests)
  - Improved enrichment speed by ~5x while respecting rate limits

- ✅ **Token Price Display Fixed**:
  - Fixed issue where tokens showed $0.000000000 on dashboard
  - Root cause: Database `current_price_usd` column only stores 4 decimal places
  - Solution: API now calculates USD prices from SOL prices (12 decimal places) for better precision
  - Modified both `/api/tokens` and `/api/tokens/realtime` endpoints
  - Fixed duplicate `/api/tokens/realtime` endpoint that was overriding the corrected version
  - Re-enabled realtime prices in dashboard (USE_REALTIME_PRICES = true)
  - Dashboard now correctly displays very small prices (e.g., $0.00004998)

- ✅ **Liquidity Calculation Improved**:
  - Dashboard was using hardcoded estimate (10% of market cap) for all tokens
  - Now calculates real liquidity for AMM/graduated tokens: Liquidity = 2 × SOL reserves × SOL price
  - API already provides `latest_virtual_sol_reserves` for graduated tokens
  - Bonding curve tokens continue using 10% estimate (they don't have traditional liquidity pools)
  - Methodology follows standard AMM liquidity calculation (2× one side of pool)

- ⚠️ **BC Progress Calculation Limitation**:
  - Our calculation uses a hardcoded 85 SOL graduation threshold
  - This is an estimation and doesn't match pump.fun's actual graduation mechanism
  - Tokens showing 100% progress may still be trading on bonding curve
  - The actual graduation trigger is more complex (possibly market cap based)
  - We're not monitoring the bonding curve account's `complete` field
  - Dashboard now shows "~100%" for tokens at or above the threshold to indicate estimation
  - See `docs/BONDING_CURVE_PROGRESS_ISSUE.md` for detailed analysis and implementation guide

  - Dashboard refresh interval reduced to 3 seconds
  - New /api/tokens/realtime endpoint bypasses database for fresh prices
  - Prices now update within seconds instead of minutes
- ✅ **Parser Directory Reorganization** (Jan 4):
  - Moved `src/parsers/` to `src/utils/parsers/` for better organization
  - Updated all import paths throughout codebase
  - Removed redundant `base-strategy.ts` file
  - Fixed import issues in strategy files
- ✅ **Raydium Monitor Implementation** (Jan 4):
  - Created RaydiumMonitor class to track graduated tokens on Raydium AMM
  - Implemented SimpleRaydiumTradeStrategy parser for swap detection
  - Added to main application startup sequence
  - Successfully parsing Raydium swaps with ~85% parse rate
  - Extracts actual trade amounts from ray_log data
  - Integrated with existing trade handler and database

### Previous Changes (Jan 2)
- ✅ Fixed AMM virtual reserves storage - changed from decimal to bigint
- ✅ Fixed bonding curve progress tracking - calculated for all BC trades
- ✅ SOL price updater starts automatically
- ✅ Dashboard shows token counters in sub-header
- ✅ All 4 monitors running successfully
- ✅ System processing ~38 TPS combined

### System Performance
- **BC Monitor**: ~24.5 trades/second
- **AMM Monitor**: ~13.8 trades/second
- **Total TPS**: ~38 combined
- **Parse Rate**: >95% for both BC and AMM
- **Enrichment**: Automatic with rate limiting
- **Graduation Detection**: Automatic with fixing service

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Common Issues
1. **Shyft gRPC connection limit**: "Maximum connection count reached"
   - Solution: Wait 5-10 minutes or use different token
   - Script available: `./scripts/fix-connection-limit.sh`

2. **Missed graduations**: Some tokens not marked as graduated
   - Solution: GraduationFixerService runs automatically
   - Manual fix: `npx tsx src/scripts/fix-graduated-tokens.ts`

3. **DNS resolution errors**: AMM account monitor connection issues
   - Solution: Usually resolves on retry

4. **Enrichment counter**: Shows 0 but enrichment is working
   - This is a cosmetic issue only

5. **Token prices showing as $0.000000000**: Database precision limitation
   - Cause: `current_price_usd` column only stores 4 decimal places
   - Solution: API now calculates from SOL price for better precision

### UTF-8 Encoding Issues (Fixed Jan 4, 2025)
**Issue**: PostgreSQL errors "invalid byte sequence for encoding UTF8"
- Some token names or addresses contained invalid UTF-8 characters
- Prevented trades from being saved to database

**Solution**: Created UTF-8 sanitizer utility
- Removes NULL bytes and control characters
- Handles Latin-1 to UTF-8 conversion
- Preserves valid Unicode (emojis, international chars)
- All string fields sanitized before database insertion

### Data Path Notes
- gRPC transaction path: `data.transaction.transaction.transaction`
- Price calculation fallback: Uses trade amounts when reserves unavailable
- Metadata rate limits: 200ms between requests, batch size 20

## Important Notes

- Always use `npm run start` for production
- BC save threshold: $8,888 market cap
- AMM save threshold: $1,000 market cap
- All monitors use dependency injection
- Events drive cross-component communication
- Dashboard updates every 10 seconds
- Token age shows blockchain creation time when available
- FDV = Market Cap × 10 (pump.fun tokens have 10% circulating supply)
- TradingActivityMonitor tracks graduated tokens across all venues (BC, AMM, Raydium)
