This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Overview

Real-time Solana token monitor for pump.fun bonding curves and pump.swap AMM pools. Streams blockchain data via Shyft's gRPC, tracks prices/market caps, saves high-value tokens (â‰¥$8,888) to PostgreSQL.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run start        # Run all 4 monitors (RECOMMENDED)
npm run dashboard    # Web dashboard (http://localhost:3001)
npm run build       # Build TypeScript
```

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Monitors**: BC (bonding curve) and AMM monitors for trades/accounts
- **Shared Stream**: Single gRPC connection shared by all monitors

## Recent Updates (January 2025)

### Latest Changes (Jan 3-4)
- âœ… **Major Code Reorganization**:
  - Reorganized `src/services/` from 40 files to 28 files in logical subdirectories
  - Reorganized `src/utils/` from 12 files to 10 files in logical subdirectories
  - Deleted 15 redundant/unused files
  - Merged sol-price.ts and sol-price-updater.ts into single sol-price-service.ts
  - Fixed all import paths throughout codebase
  - Build completes successfully with no TypeScript errors
- âœ… **Dashboard Price Display Issue**:
  - Identified that tokens showing $0.0001 are graduated to Raydium AMM
  - Current system only monitors pump.swap AMM, missing Raydium graduations
  - This causes 100% progress tokens to show default price of $0.0001
  - Workaround: Run `npx tsx src/scripts/fix-graduated-tokens.ts`
  - Proper fix: Implement Raydium AMM monitoring
- âœ… Added GraduationFixerService - automatically detects and fixes graduated tokens
  - Runs on startup and every 5 minutes
  - Finds tokens with AMM trades that aren't marked as graduated
  - Updates graduation status and timestamps automatically
  - Integrated into main application lifecycle
- âœ… Dashboard improvements:
  - Token counters show total counts for each type (e.g., "New Tokens 154")
  - Removed 24hr % and Volume 24h columns for cleaner layout
  - Renamed "Holders" column to "Links" with pump.fun and Solscan icons
  - Icons link directly to token pages on respective platforms
  - Fixed token age display - now shows actual blockchain creation time when available
  - Unified header across all dashboard pages with live SOL price and connection status
  - Renamed "Streaming Metrics" to "Stream" for cleaner navigation
- âœ… Fixed graduated tokens detection for 10 tokens including SCAM token
- âœ… Token creation time improvements:
  - Dashboard displays actual blockchain creation time when available
  - Falls back to "first seen" time when creation time unavailable
  - Tooltip explains the source of the age data
  - Update script fetches creation times from multiple sources (RPC, Shyft, Helius)
- âœ… Code cleanup:
  - Removed .DS_Store files
  - TypeScript compilation verified (no errors)
  - Build process successful
- âœ… Real-time price updates:
  - Added RealtimePriceCache service for instant price updates
  - Reduced batch processing delays from 1s to 250ms
  - Dashboard refresh interval reduced to 3 seconds
  - New /api/tokens/realtime endpoint bypasses database for fresh prices
  - Prices now update within seconds instead of minutes
- âœ… **Parser Directory Reorganization** (Jan 4):
  - Moved `src/parsers/` to `src/utils/parsers/` for better organization
  - Updated all import paths throughout codebase
  - Removed redundant `base-strategy.ts` file
  - Fixed import issues in strategy files
- ðŸš§ **Raydium Monitor Implementation** (Jan 4):
  - Created RaydiumMonitor class to track graduated tokens on Raydium AMM
  - Implemented SimpleRaydiumTradeStrategy parser for swap detection
  - Added to main application startup sequence
  - **ISSUE: 0% parse rate - no Raydium transactions being received**
  - Created debugging scripts to investigate subscription issues
  - Needs further investigation - see "Raydium Monitor Issues" section below

### Previous Changes (Jan 2)
- âœ… Fixed AMM virtual reserves storage - changed from decimal to bigint
- âœ… Fixed bonding curve progress tracking - calculated for all BC trades
- âœ… SOL price updater starts automatically
- âœ… Dashboard shows token counters in sub-header
- âœ… All 4 monitors running successfully
- âœ… System processing ~38 TPS combined

### System Performance
- **BC Monitor**: ~24.5 trades/second
- **AMM Monitor**: ~13.8 trades/second
- **Total TPS**: ~38 combined
- **Parse Rate**: >95% for both BC and AMM
- **Enrichment**: Automatic with rate limiting
- **Graduation Detection**: Automatic with fixing service

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Common Issues
1. **Shyft gRPC connection limit**: "Maximum connection count reached"
   - Solution: Wait 5-10 minutes or use different token
   - Script available: `./scripts/fix-connection-limit.sh`

2. **Missed graduations**: Some tokens not marked as graduated
   - Solution: GraduationFixerService runs automatically
   - Manual fix: `npx tsx src/scripts/fix-graduated-tokens.ts`

3. **DNS resolution errors**: AMM account monitor connection issues
   - Solution: Usually resolves on retry

4. **Enrichment counter**: Shows 0 but enrichment is working
   - This is a cosmetic issue only

### Raydium Monitor Issues (Jan 4, 2025)
**Status**: Implemented but not receiving transactions (0% parse rate)

**What was done**:
1. Created `RaydiumMonitor` class extending BaseMonitor
2. Implemented `SimpleRaydiumTradeStrategy` parser for swap detection
3. Added Raydium events to EventBus (RAYDIUM_SWAP, RAYDIUM_LIQUIDITY)
4. Integrated with main application startup
5. Created standalone runner: `npm run raydium-monitor`

**Issues Found**:
1. **No Raydium transactions received**: The gRPC subscription filter doesn't seem to work
   - Tried `accountInclude: [RAYDIUM_PROGRAM_ID]` - no transactions received
   - Direct monitor also receives 0 Raydium transactions
   - Shared stream manager might be overriding subscription configs
2. **Parser shows 0% success rate**: No transactions to parse
3. **Subscription mechanism unclear**: Need to investigate proper Raydium filtering

**Debugging Scripts Created**:
- `src/run-raydium-monitor-direct.ts` - Direct gRPC connection test
- `src/scripts/test-raydium-stream.ts` - Test subscription
- `src/scripts/find-raydium-transactions.ts` - Search all transactions

**Next Steps**:
1. Verify Raydium program ID is correct: `675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8`
2. Test different subscription approaches (monitor all, filter client-side)
3. Check if graduated tokens are actually using Raydium vs other AMMs
4. Consider monitoring pump.fun graduations first, then track on Raydium

**Original Issue**: Pump.fun tokens graduating to Raydium show $0.0001 price
- Dashboard shows incorrect price for Raydium-graduated tokens
- Need working Raydium monitor to fix this

### Data Path Notes
- gRPC transaction path: `data.transaction.transaction.transaction`
- Price calculation fallback: Uses trade amounts when reserves unavailable
- Metadata rate limits: 200ms between requests, batch size 20

## Scripts & Utilities

### Token Management
```bash
# Fix graduated tokens manually
npx tsx src/scripts/fix-graduated-tokens.ts

# Update token creation times
npx tsx src/scripts/update-top-tokens-creation-times.ts  # Top tokens only
npx tsx src/scripts/update-token-creation-times.ts       # All tokens
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Development mode with hot reload
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run lint         # Check code quality

## Important Notes

- Always use `npm run start` for production
- BC save threshold: $8,888 market cap
- AMM save threshold: $1,000 market cap
- All monitors use dependency injection
- Events drive cross-component communication
- Dashboard updates every 10 seconds
- Token age shows blockchain creation time when available
- FDV = Market Cap Ã— 10 (pump.fun tokens have 10% circulating supply)
- **Graduated tokens showing $0.0001**: These graduated to Raydium (not monitored)
