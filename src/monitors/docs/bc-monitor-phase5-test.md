## Implementation Details

### Components Created
1. **bc-progress-tracker.ts**
   - `calculateDetailedProgress()` - Full progress data
   - `formatProgressDisplay()` - Enhanced visual display
   - `ProgressTracker` class - Tracks history and candidates
   - `detectGraduationFromLogs()` - Graduation detection

2. **Monitor Integration**
   - Progress tracking for every trade
   - Graduation checks in transaction parsing
   - Enhanced trade event display
   - Progress statistics in monitor stats

## Performance Metrics

- **No Performance Impact**: Progress calculations are lightweight
- **Memory Efficient**: Only tracks active tokens
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant progress calculations

## Phase 5 Checklist Completed

- [x] Calculate progress from reserves/lamports
- [x] Track progression over time
- [x] Detect 100% completion
- [x] Flag tokens ready for graduation
- [x] Detect graduation transactions
- [x] Update token status
- [x] Record graduation details
- [x] Track migration to AMM

## Key Observations

1. **Graduation Success**: Found a real graduation at 91.70 SOL
2. **Progress Accuracy**: Calculations match expected behavior
3. **Visual Clarity**: Enhanced display makes progress easy to understand
4. **Milestone System**: Provides quick status understanding
5. **Near-Graduation Tracking**: Helpful for watching tokens close to completion

## Next Steps

Phase 5 is complete and working excellently. The progress tracking and graduation detection add significant value to the monitor. All core features are now implemented and tested successfully.
