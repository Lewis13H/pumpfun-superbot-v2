# Phase 2 Test Results - Bonding Curve Monitor

## Test Summary
**Date**: 2025-06-28  
**Duration**: 30 seconds  
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

## Test Results

### ✅ Transaction Parsing
- Successfully parsed pump.fun transactions
- Extracted trade events from "Program data:" logs
- Used correct event size (225 bytes)
- Correct virtual reserve offsets (97, 105)

### ✅ Trade Detection
- **Total Transactions**: 700+
- **Trades Detected**: 754
- **Detection Rate**: 107.3% (multiple trades per transaction)
- **Parse Errors**: Only 6 (< 1%)

### ✅ Trade Type Classification
- **Buys Detected**: 400+
- **Sells Detected**: 220+
- Successfully identified trade direction from logs
- "Instruction: Buy" and "Instruction: Sell" patterns working

### ✅ Data Extraction
- Mint addresses correctly extracted
- User addresses properly decoded
- SOL amounts accurate (verified with manual calculation)
- Token amounts properly parsed
- Virtual reserves correctly read from offsets

### ✅ Unique Token Tracking
- **Unique Tokens**: 52 different tokens detected
- Popular tokens like `9ogSqEVq...SVpump` appeared frequently
- Proper deduplication using Set

## Sample Trade Event Captured
```
Type: BUY
Mint: 9ogSqEVq...SVpump
User: 6W9igUsq...
SOL Amount: 0.0131 SOL
Token Amount: 356414.55
Virtual SOL: 34.40 SOL
Virtual Tokens: 935663855
Signature: 2VwB2EZj24qrfsBy...
```

## Phase 2 Checklist Completed

- [x] Parse "Program data:" logs for trade events
- [x] Extract mint, virtual reserves from event data
- [x] Handle event data structure (225 bytes)
- [x] Identify buy/sell from instruction names
- [x] Extract user addresses from accounts
- [x] Parse SOL and token amounts
- [x] Handle failed transactions
- [x] Validate mint addresses (44 chars, base58)
- [x] Verify event data size (225 bytes)
- [x] Check reserve values are reasonable
- [x] Filter out invalid events

## Key Observations

1. **High Detection Rate**: Successfully parsing multiple trades per transaction
2. **Buy/Sell Ratio**: Approximately 2:1 (buys to sells)
3. **Popular Tokens**: Some tokens like `9ogSqEVq...SVpump` had very high activity
4. **Event Structure**: Confirmed 225-byte event size with reserves at offsets 97/105
5. **Performance**: Parsing adds minimal overhead to streaming

## Debug Insights

- Found many pump.fun transactions with Program data
- Event sizes consistently 225 bytes (matching TRADE_EVENT_SIZE constant)
- No 113-byte events found (old format)
- Virtual reserves showing reasonable values (30-85 SOL range)

## Next Steps

Phase 2 is complete and stable. Ready to proceed to Phase 3: Price Calculations & Market Cap

### Improvements for Phase 3:
1. Calculate accurate token prices from reserves
2. Convert to USD using SOL price service
3. Calculate market caps with 1B supply assumption
4. Track price changes over time
