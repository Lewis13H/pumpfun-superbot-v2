# Graduation Investigation Results

## Summary
The 3 tokens investigated are NOT graduated. Our system is correctly showing them as not graduated.

## Evidence

### Token 1: parallax (4UfTYHPXA1JKnG2mi6eQPv3s5vhiVP358Ko9MDxxpump)
- **Database Progress**: 100.00% (INCORRECT - likely from old trade data)
- **On-chain Progress**: 0.00% (0.0020 SOL in bonding curve)
- **AMM Trades**: 0
- **Bonding Curve Account**: Still open
- **Complete Flag**: false

### Token 2: ALPACU (B3pHPprgBgmPVkpQyJv3YfrLUTBrxxYYeJtfF5nrpump)
- **Database Progress**: 100.00% (INCORRECT - likely from old trade data)
- **On-chain Progress**: 0.00% (0.0020 SOL in bonding curve)
- **AMM Trades**: 0
- **Bonding Curve Account**: Still open
- **Complete Flag**: false

### Token 3: CoW3 (BgoBs6JQDU1fZqiheJX2aWFj9XvtWtu8755uhVvNpump)
- **Database Progress**: 0.00% (CORRECT)
- **On-chain Progress**: 0.00% (0.0020 SOL in bonding curve)
- **AMM Trades**: 0
- **Bonding Curve Account**: Still open
- **Complete Flag**: false

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Incorrect Progress in Database
- Two tokens show 100% progress but only have 0.002 SOL on-chain
- This is the exact issue we fixed earlier - progress was calculated from trade virtualSolReserves
- These tokens likely had trades with large virtualSolReserves values that made them appear at 100%

### Issue 2: pump.fun Website Confusion
- The pump.fun website might be showing these as "graduated" for different reasons:
  1. UI bug on their end
  2. They might show "graduated" for tokens that are dead/rugged
  3. Their definition of "graduated" might differ from actual on-chain graduation

### Issue 3: No Account Monitoring for Progress Updates
- Since we're not getting account updates for these specific tokens, the incorrect 100% progress persists
- Our bonding curve account monitoring would fix this if these accounts were actively trading

## Why Our System is Correct

1. **No AMM Trades**: Graduated tokens MUST have AMM trades. These have zero.
2. **Open BC Accounts**: Graduated tokens have closed bonding curve accounts. These are still open.
3. **Minimal SOL**: Only 0.002 SOL in the curve (0.00% of 84 SOL target)
4. **No Complete Flag**: The authoritative `complete` boolean is false

## Recommended Actions

1. **Run Progress Reset Script**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/scripts/reset-incorrect-bc-progress.ts
   ```
   This will fix the incorrect 100% progress values.

2. **Verify pump.fun Display**:
   - Check if pump.fun shows these as "graduated" or something else
   - They might show a different status like "dead" or "rugged"

3. **Monitor These Tokens**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/scripts/test-bc-account-monitoring.ts
   ```
   Watch for any bonding curve updates to ensure progress tracking works.

## Conclusion

Our graduation detection system is working correctly. These tokens are NOT graduated:
- ✅ Our system correctly shows `graduated_to_amm: false`
- ✅ Our system correctly shows `bonding_curve_complete: false`
- ❌ The progress values need correction (100% → 0%)

The issue is stale progress data from before we implemented accurate account-based monitoring.
