# Session 7: Data Pipeline Architecture - Summary

## Overview
Created a unified data pipeline that normalizes events from all domain monitors and efficiently processes them through batching, caching, and persistence layers.

## Components Created

### 1. DataPipeline (`src/services/pipeline/data-pipeline.ts`)
- Central event processing and routing system
- Singleton pattern with EventBus injection
- Features:
  - Event normalization across all monitor types
  - Batch processing with configurable size and timeout
  - Dynamic processor routing based on event types
  - Comprehensive metrics collection
  - Error handling with retry logic

### 2. EventProcessor (`src/services/pipeline/event-processor.ts`)
- Handles batch processing of normalized events
- Features:
  - Caching support for duplicate event detection
  - Retry logic with configurable attempts
  - Multiple processor types (database, analytics, cache, token, trade, liquidity, pool)
  - Processing statistics tracking

### 3. EventNormalizer (`src/services/pipeline/event-normalizer.ts`)
- Converts raw events from various sources into normalized format
- Handles event types:
  - Token lifecycle events (created, graduated, phase changes)
  - Trade events (including MEV detection and high slippage)
  - Liquidity events (add, remove, fee collection)
  - Pool state updates
- Automatic source inference (bonding_curve, amm_pool, external_amm)

### 4. BatchManager (`src/services/pipeline/batch-manager.ts`)
- Manages event batching with size and timeout constraints
- Features:
  - Automatic batch flushing on size or timeout
  - Batch statistics tracking
  - Configurable batch parameters

### 5. PipelineMetrics (`src/services/pipeline/pipeline-metrics.ts`)
- Comprehensive performance tracking
- Metrics include:
  - Processing time percentiles (P50, P90, P99)
  - Throughput measurements
  - Queue depth tracking
  - Event type and source breakdowns
  - Error rates by category

## Integration

### SmartStreamManager Integration
- Added `pipelineConfig` option to SmartStreamManagerOptions
- Pipeline initialization during stream manager startup
- Automatic EventBus injection
- Pipeline shutdown on stream manager stop
- Pipeline stats included in overall system statistics

### Container Factory Update
- Modified to pass pipeline configuration from container
- Supports dynamic pipeline configuration

## Event Flow

1. Domain monitors emit events to EventBus
2. DataPipeline listens for all relevant events
3. EventNormalizer converts events to standard format
4. BatchManager groups events for efficient processing
5. EventProcessor routes batches to appropriate handlers
6. PipelineMetrics tracks performance throughout

## Configuration

```typescript
const pipelineConfig = {
  batchSize: 100,              // Events per batch
  batchTimeout: 2000,          // Max wait time (ms)
  maxRetries: 3,               // Retry attempts for failed events
  enableCaching: true,         // Duplicate detection
  enableMetrics: true,         // Performance tracking
  processors: [                // Active processors
    'database',
    'analytics', 
    'cache',
    'token',
    'trade',
    'liquidity',
    'pool'
  ]
};
```

## Test Script
Created `test-session-7.ts` to validate:
- Pipeline initialization and configuration
- Event normalization across all monitor types
- Batch processing functionality
- Metrics collection and reporting
- Integration with domain monitors

## Benefits

1. **Unified Event Processing**: Single pipeline for all event types
2. **Performance**: Batch processing reduces overhead
3. **Reliability**: Retry logic and error handling
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics and statistics
5. **Flexibility**: Configurable processors and routing rules
6. **Scalability**: Efficient batching and caching

## Next Steps

- Session 9: Advanced MEV Detection
- Session 10: Production Deployment & Monitoring
