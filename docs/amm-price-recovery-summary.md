# AMM Price Recovery Implementation Summary

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Fixed SOL mint contamination** - Removed 1,028 incorrect entries
2. **Verified mint mapping** - AMM account monitor correctly uses `quoteMint`
3. **Created diagnostic tools** - Multiple scripts to verify and test recovery
4. **Discovered Shyft limitations** - No direct token account balance queries

### ❌ Issues Discovered
1. **No reserve data** - All pools have 0 reserves because:
   - AMM account monitor only decodes pool structure
   - Shyft doesn't provide `spl_Account` table for token balances
   - Trade events don't include post-trade reserve states

2. **Shyft AMM data structure** - `pump_fun_amm_Pool` exists but:
   - Can find pools by token mint
   - Cannot query token account balances
   - Need alternative approach for reserves

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AMM Account Monitor V2 (Partial)
- Created `amm-account-monitor-v2.ts` with token account subscriptions
- Would track vault balances in real-time
- Requires running alongside existing monitors

### 2. Shyft AMM Price Recovery (Limited)
- Created `shyft-amm-price-recovery.ts`
- Can find AMM pools for tokens
- Cannot get reserves without token account data

### 3. External API Fallback (Failed)
- Jupiter API attempt failed (DNS issues)
- Would provide immediate price relief
- Consider other APIs (Birdeye, DexScreener)

## Recommended Path Forward

### Option A: Real-time Reserve Tracking (Best Long-term)
1. Deploy `amm-account-monitor-v2` in production
2. Let it build up reserve data over time
3. Price recovery will work once data accumulates

### Option B: Trade Event Enhancement (Quick Fix)
1. Modify AMM monitor to extract reserves from logs
2. Parse transaction logs for pool state updates
3. Store reserves with each trade

### Option C: External Price API (Immediate Relief)
1. Use Birdeye or DexScreener API
2. Update graduated token prices periodically
3. Fall back to on-chain when API fails

## Current Architecture

```
Price Update Sources:
1. Real-time monitors (BC & AMM trades) ✅
2. GraphQL bulk recovery (BC only) ✅
3. AMM pool state recovery ❌ (no reserves)
4. External APIs ❌ (not implemented)
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Shyft Limitations**
   - Great for transaction streaming
   - Limited for account state queries
   - No generic token account balance endpoint

2. **Architecture Insights**
   - Need to capture state at transaction time
   - Post-hoc recovery is difficult without RPC
   - External APIs may be necessary for stale tokens

3. **Data Flow Issues**
   - Graduated tokens lose price updates after initial AMM activity
   - Pool reserves must be tracked continuously
   - Recovery mechanisms need multiple fallbacks

## Files Created/Modified

### Scripts
- `fix-amm-pool-mint-mapping.ts` - Database cleanup
- `fetch-amm-pool-reserves.ts` - RPC reserve fetcher (rate limited)
- `test-jupiter-prices.ts` - External API test
- `test-shyft-amm-pools.ts` - GraphQL exploration
- `check-shyft-schema.ts` - Schema discovery
- `test-enhanced-price-recovery.ts` - Integration test

### Services
- `shyft-amm-price-recovery.ts` - Shyft-based recovery
- `jupiter-price-service.ts` - External API integration
- Modified `unified-graphql-price-recovery.ts` - Added Shyft fallback

### Monitors
- `amm-account-monitor-v2.ts` - Enhanced with vault tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement external API fallback (Birdeye/DexScreener)
2. **Short-term**: Deploy enhanced AMM monitor to build reserve data
3. **Long-term**: Enhance trade parsing to capture reserve snapshots
