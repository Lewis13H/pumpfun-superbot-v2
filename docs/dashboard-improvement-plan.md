# Dashboard Improvement Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the systematic enhancement of the pump.fun monitoring dashboard to provide comprehensive real-time analytics, improved user experience, and full integration with all monitoring systems. The implementation is divided into focused sessions that build upon each other.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Infrastructure
- ✅ Express API server with RESTful endpoints
- ✅ WebSocket server for real-time BC updates
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with rich data
- ✅ Frontend with responsive design
- ✅ Three active monitors (BC, AMM, AMM Account)

### Key Limitations
- ❌ No AMM real-time integration
- ❌ Limited data visualization
- ❌ Basic filtering capabilities
- ❌ No historical charts
- ❌ Underutilized collected data

## Implementation Sessions

### ⚠️ PROJECT ON HOLD (June 28, 2025)

**Dashboard improvements have been put ON HOLD due to WebSocket connection issues blocking core system development.**

**Decision**: Rather than continue debugging the unified WebSocket implementation, we are:
1. Disabling the unified WebSocket server to unblock development
2. Continuing with core system enhancements from master-plan.md
3. Will return to dashboard improvements after core features are complete

**Technical Issues Encountered**:
- WebSocket connection immediately disconnects after upgrade
- TypeScript/JavaScript module import conflicts with 'ws' library
- Connection handler not being properly invoked despite successful upgrade
- Multiple attempted fixes did not resolve the core issue

**To Resume This Project**:
1. Review and fix the WebSocket implementation in `unified-websocket-server.ts`
2. Ensure proper TypeScript imports for the 'ws' module
3. Test connection thoroughly before re-enabling
4. Remove disabled code blocks in `server-unified.ts` and `unified-websocket-client.js`

The modular approach allows for adjustments based on user feedback and technical constraints.

Total estimated time: 12 development days
Priority: High-impact features first (real-time integration, price charts, AMM analytics)
Next steps: Begin with Session 1 - AMM Integration & Real-time Infrastructure
