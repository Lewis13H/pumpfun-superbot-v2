# Streaming Metrics Dashboard - Real Data Integration

## Overview
The streaming metrics dashboard has been updated to use real performance data from the existing monitoring system instead of mock data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Performance Optimization Controller
- **Optimization Status**: Now uses real health score from `performanceMonitor`
- **Resource Metrics**: Pulls actual CPU and memory usage from system metrics
- **SSE Streaming**: Broadcasts real monitor throughput and system health
- **Efficiency Calculation**: Based on actual health score (0-100%)

### 2. Fault Tolerance Controller
- **Health Status**: Calculates from real monitor statuses (healthy/degraded/failed)
- **Circuit Breakers**: Maps monitor health to circuit breaker states
  - `healthy` → `CLOSED`
  - `degraded` → `HALF_OPEN`
  - `unhealthy`/`disconnected` → `OPEN`
- **Alerts**: Combines real error logs from `performanceMonitor` with any fault tolerance alerts

### 3. Real Data Sources

#### From Performance Monitor
- **System Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, uptime
- **Monitor Status**: Health status, messages/second, parse rates
- **Error Logs**: Real-time error tracking with severity levels
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Based on actual performance thresholds

#### Mapped to Dashboard
- **Health Score**: Calculated from monitor health and system metrics
- **Throughput**: Sum of all monitor messages/second
- **Parse Rates**: Individual monitor parse success rates
- **Latency**: Average processing latency per monitor

## What's Real vs Mock

### Real Data
- ✅ CPU and memory usage
- ✅ Monitor health statuses
- ✅ Messages per second
- ✅ Parse rates
- ✅ Error logs and alerts
- ✅ System uptime
- ✅ Health score calculation

### Still Mock/Stub
- ❌ Batch processing metrics (no real batch processor)
- ❌ Cache statistics (using default values)
- ❌ State checkpoints (no state recovery service)
- ❌ Optimization parameters (using defaults)

## Dashboard Features

### Enhanced Health Score
- Weighted calculation based on:
  - Monitor health (70%)
  - System resources (20%)
  - Error rate (10%)
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds

### Circuit Breaker Visualization
- Shows actual monitor statuses
- Color-coded states based on health
- Real parse rates and latencies

### Performance Dashboard
- Real throughput from monitors
- Actual CPU/memory usage
- Live recommendations based on thresholds

### Live Alerts Feed
- Real error logs from monitors
- Severity filtering
- Timestamp ordering

## Testing the Real Data

1. Start the main application:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

2. Start the dashboard server:
   ```bash
   npm run dashboard
   ```

3. Open the enhanced dashboard:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/streaming-metrics-enhanced.html
   ```

4. Observe real data:
   - Monitor statuses should match console output
   - CPU/memory should reflect actual usage
   - Throughput should show real messages/second
   - Errors should appear in alerts feed

## API Endpoints with Real Data

### Performance Metrics
```bash
# Get current metrics (real data)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/performance/metrics

# Response includes:
{
  "system": { 
    "cpuUsage": 15.2,
    "memoryUsage": { "percentage": 45.6 }
  },
  "monitors": [
    {
      "name": "TokenLifecycleMonitor",
      "status": "healthy",
      "messagesPerSecond": 24.5,
      "parseRate": 0.97
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fault Tolerance Status
```bash
# Get fault tolerance status
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/fault-tolerance/status

# Response includes real monitor health:
{
  "health": {
    "healthy": 2,
    "degraded": 0,
    "failed": 1
  }
}
```

### Circuit Breakers
```bash
# Get circuit breaker states
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/fault-tolerance/circuit-breakers

# Response maps monitor health to circuit states:
[
  {
    "connectionId": "TokenLifecycleMonitor",
    "state": "CLOSED",
    "parseRate": 0.97,
    "latency": 12.5
  }
]
```

## Future Enhancements

To get fully real data:

1. **Integrate Fault Tolerance Services**:
   - Register `FaultTolerantManager` in container
   - Register `StateRecoveryService` in container
   - Wire up real circuit breakers

2. **Integrate Performance Services**:
   - Register `PerformanceOptimizer` in container
   - Register `DynamicBatchProcessor` in container
   - Register `AdaptiveCacheManager` in container

3. **Add Real Batch Processing**:
   - Track actual batch sizes in data pipeline
   - Monitor queue depths
   - Measure batch processing times

4. **Add Real Cache Metrics**:
   - Track cache hit/miss rates
   - Monitor eviction counts
   - Measure compression ratios
