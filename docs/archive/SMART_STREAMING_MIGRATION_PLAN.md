# Smart Streaming Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the migration strategy from the legacy monitoring system to the new smart streaming architecture with connection pooling, domain monitors, and enhanced fault tolerance.

## Migration Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Day 1-2)**: Testing & Validation
- **Phase 2 (Day 3-4)**: Gradual Rollout
- **Phase 3 (Day 5-7)**: Full Migration
- **Phase 4 (Day 8-10)**: Monitoring & Optimization

## Phase 1: Testing & Validation

### 1.1 Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests complete
- [ ] Load tests show performance improvements
- [ ] Backup current database
- [ ] Document current performance metrics
- [ ] Verify rollback procedures

### 1.2 Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone production environment
git checkout -b smart-streaming-migration

# Set test environment variables
export USE_SMART_STREAMING=true
export POOL_MAX_CONNECTIONS=2
export POOL_MIN_CONNECTIONS=2
export FAULT_TOLERANCE_ENABLED=true
export CHECKPOINT_DIR=./test-checkpoints

# Run test suite
npm run test:migration
```

### 1.3 Validation Criteria
- Parse rate: >95% (current baseline)
- Throughput: 50%+ improvement
- Memory usage: <20% increase
- Connection stability: No drops in 24hrs
- Data integrity: 100% match with legacy

## Phase 2: Gradual Rollout

### 2.1 Canary Deployment (25%)
```bash
# Enable for 25% of monitors
export SMART_STREAMING_CANARY=0.25

# Monitor performance
npm run monitor:canary
```

### 2.2 Progressive Rollout
- Day 3: 25% → Monitor for 12 hours
- Day 4 AM: 50% → Monitor for 8 hours
- Day 4 PM: 75% → Monitor for 4 hours

### 2.3 Rollback Triggers
Automatic rollback if any of these occur:
- Parse rate drops below 90%
- Connection failures > 3 in 1 hour
- Memory usage > 80%
- Unhandled errors increase by 50%

## Phase 3: Full Migration

### 3.1 Pre-Migration Steps
1. **Announce maintenance window**
   - 2-hour window for full migration
   - Off-peak hours recommended

2. **Create checkpoint**
   ```bash
   npm run checkpoint:create
   ```

3. **Stop legacy monitors**
   ```bash
   npm run monitors:stop:legacy
   ```

### 3.2 Migration Steps
1. **Update configuration**
   ```bash
   # Update .env
   USE_SMART_STREAMING=true
   POOL_MAX_CONNECTIONS=3
   POOL_MIN_CONNECTIONS=2
   FAULT_TOLERANCE_ENABLED=true
   ```

2. **Start smart streaming**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

3. **Verify all monitors active**
   ```bash
   npm run monitors:verify
   ```

### 3.3 Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] All domain monitors running
- [ ] Connection pool healthy
- [ ] Metrics match expectations
- [ ] No data gaps
- [ ] Alerts configured

## Phase 4: Monitoring & Optimization

### 4.1 Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Performance Metrics**
   - TPS (target: 100+)
   - Parse rate (target: >98%)
   - Latency (target: <100ms)
   - Memory usage trend

2. **Reliability Metrics**
   - Uptime (target: 99.9%)
   - Recovery time (target: <30s)
   - Circuit breaker trips
   - Checkpoint frequency

3. **Business Metrics**
   - Token discovery rate
   - Enrichment success rate
   - Database write throughput

### 4.2 Optimization Opportunities
1. **Connection Pool Tuning**
   ```typescript
   // Adjust based on load
   POOL_MAX_CONNECTIONS=4
   POOL_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=20000
   ```

2. **Batch Size Optimization**
   ```typescript
   // Monitor and adjust
   BATCH_MIN_SIZE=20
   BATCH_MAX_SIZE=200
   BATCH_TIMEOUT=500
   ```

3. **Cache Tuning**
   ```typescript
   // Based on hit rates
   CACHE_TTL_MULTIPLIER=1.5
   CACHE_COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD=5000
   ```

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Stop smart streaming
npm run stop

# Restore environment
export USE_SMART_STREAMING=false

# Start legacy monitors
npm run start:legacy

# Verify operation
npm run monitors:verify:legacy
```

### Data Recovery
```bash
# If data gaps detected
npm run recovery:replay --from-checkpoint

# Verify data integrity
npm run data:verify --compare-legacy
```

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   - Mitigation: Conservative initial limits
   - Monitor: Connection usage %
   - Action: Scale connections if >80%

2. **Memory Leaks**
   - Mitigation: Heap snapshots every 6hrs
   - Monitor: Memory growth rate
   - Action: Rolling restart if needed

3. **Data Loss During Migration**
   - Mitigation: Parallel run for 1hr
   - Monitor: Data comparison
   - Action: Replay from checkpoint

### Contingency Plans
1. **Total System Failure**
   - Restore from backup
   - Use checkpoint recovery
   - Manual intervention procedures

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Reduce connection count
   - Disable non-critical features
   - Increase batch timeouts

## Success Criteria

### Go/No-Go Decision Points
1. **After Phase 1**: 
   - All tests passing?
   - Performance gains verified?
   
2. **After Phase 2**:
   - Canary stable for 24hrs?
   - No critical issues?
   
3. **After Phase 3**:
   - All monitors migrated?
   - Metrics within targets?
