## Critical Updates During Implementation

### Shyft Rate Limit Compliance (Added after Session 5)
After reviewing Shyft's gRPC examples, we discovered and fixed a critical issue:
- **Problem**: Health checks were creating test subscriptions, counting towards the 100/60s limit
- **Solution**: Implemented `SubscriptionRateLimiter` and removed all test subscriptions
- **Result**: Full compliance with Shyft's rate limits, no risk of connection exhaustion
- **Documentation**: See `CONNECTION_POOL_FIXES.md` for detailed implementation
