### 3. Performance Metrics

**Processing Performance**
- **Transactions Received**: 4,153
- **Trades Parsed**: 3,806
- **Parse Errors**: 349
- **Error Rate**: 8.4%
- **Average Latency**: 49.1ms

**Event Size Distribution**
- 225 bytes: 4,058 events
- 96 bytes: 20 events  
- 280 bytes: 6 events

### 4. BC Account Monitor Results
- **Account Updates**: 0
- **Graduations Detected**: 0
- **Runtime**: 2 minutes
- **Status**: Not receiving account update events

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Timestamp Conversion Bug üö®
**Issue**: All timestamps showing January 21, 1970
**Impact**: Cannot track time-based metrics or historical data
**Example**: `1970-01-21 13:59:43.567+07:30`

### 2. Missing Metadata üö®
**Issue**: No token names or symbols captured
**Impact**: Tokens cannot be identified by users
**Cause**: Metadata enrichment service not running automatically

### 3. BC Account Monitor Failure üö®
**Issue**: Receiving 0 account updates
**Impact**: Cannot detect graduations or track BC state changes
**Cause**: Subscription configuration issue

### 4. Incorrect Account Extraction ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Issue**: Bonding curve keys differ between trades for same token
**Impact**: Cannot accurately track bonding curve state
**Example**: Same token has 10+ different BC keys in trades

### 5. Creator Address Mismatch ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Issue**: Creator addresses don't match pump.fun data
**Impact**: Cannot accurately attribute token creation

## Positive Findings ‚úÖ

1. **High Parse Rate**: 91.6% of transactions successfully parsed
2. **Fast Processing**: 49.1ms average parse time
3. **Volume Tracking**: Accurate USD volume calculations
4. **Threshold Detection**: Correctly identifying tokens above $8,888
5. **Progress Tracking**: BC progress calculations working
6. **Trade Classification**: Buy/sell detection accurate

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required
1. **Fix timestamp conversion** from slot time to Unix timestamp
2. **Enable metadata enrichment** to run with monitors
3. **Debug BC Account Monitor** subscription configuration
4. **Fix account extraction** logic to get correct BC address
5. **Verify creator extraction** from transaction data

### Data Verification Needed
1. Cross-reference more tokens with pump.fun data
2. Validate trade prices against on-chain data
3. Verify bonding curve progress calculations
4. Check creator address extraction logic

### Performance Optimizations
1. Investigate 8.4% parse error rate
2. Optimize for different event sizes
3. Consider batching database writes

## Conclusion

The BC Monitor core functionality is working well with a 91.6% parse rate and accurate price tracking. However, several critical data extraction issues need to be resolved:
- Timestamp conversion
- Metadata enrichment
- Account monitor functionality
- Correct account extraction

Once these issues are fixed, the system should provide accurate and complete bonding curve monitoring data.
